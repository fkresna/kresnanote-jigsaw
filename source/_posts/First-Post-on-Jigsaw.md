This is my first post using Jigsaw, I was using several different HTML static website generator in the past like jekyll but I don't like it when I install it, That was back on 2013, maybe because I'm not using Ruby on daily so I feel that the installation is complicated, I play around with it for some time but I don't feel comfortable so I do not continue using Jekyll, I read it somewhere that Jekyll now is better and I'm happy if they improve themself, I always like open source project . Then I read about Hugo around 2016 and I like it for a while, The installation is easy, the compilation is fast but what make me feels that I need another static website generator is because sometimes I need to edit HTML template on my own, I want to put my own variable maybe because I'm not familiar with Golang so I feel it's too complicated to modify it so I'm looking for another alternative that suitable for my need, FOr several times I created my own simple static site generator using PHP and Twig and it works for me but I realize if the website is growing it will be tough to generate the page one by one so I was surfing around the internet and I found jigsaw. 

When I play around with it, I spend around an hours to finally understand a bit on how the way it works, It has simple and good documentation so I'm enjoying the process and another hour to modify the template then I realized it's not for beginner but I think it's best suitable for me right now because of it's flexibility, I want the ability to modify the HTML and want to do add several variables in my post.


Jigsaw not for you if
 
* You don't know anything about programming because you will need to create HTML template on your own.
* You just want to write and does not want to tweak a lot.


Jigsaw is best for

* People that know PHP and comfortable with command line interface.
* People that want flexibility on their static website generator.
